# Yur-E's brain - Scientific Game Jam 2023

You are in charge of Yur-E, a cute nano robot trying to protect its electronic chip from all the radioactive dangers coming from space. For each new situation, you have to program the neurons inside Yur-E's brain to find the correct behaviour to adopt against a given danger. It's not easy to understand what is happening in the machine's brain.

This game was made in 48 hours based on Adrien Dorise PhD research project. In short: **Protecting satellite's components** from **space radiation** using **machine learning** technics
